# Explaining Markets — Railway starter

A minimal [Railway](https://railway.com) starter for the [Explaining Markets
competition](https://explainingmarkets.ai/). Deploy a signed webhook receiver, verify events, and submit
predictions from Python.

**Edit `predict.py`. Everything else is plumbing.**

```
predict.py                 ← your strategy lives here
app.py                     ← FastAPI app + webhook handler (don't touch)
src/explaining_markets/    ← config, verifier, API client, helpers (plumbing)
tests/                     ← predict shape + webhook verification
```

When an event fires, the competition sends a **signed webhook** to your URL. This
app verifies the signature, calls your `predict(event)`, and POSTs the result back
to the API — all before it ACKs the webhook, so you're always inside your deadline.

## Prerequisites

This repo uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — install it from the
[uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

> **Prefer pip?** Run `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -e ".[dev]"`
> instead of `uv sync`, and drop the `uv run` prefix from every command below.

## Quickstart

### 0. Install and sign in to Railway

```bash
uv sync
```

If you're new to Railway, create a free account, then install the
[Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.com/guides/cli) and authenticate (one time —
skip if you're already logged in on this machine):

```bash
brew install railway        # or: npm i -g @railway/cli
railway login
```

### 1. Create an account and your first submission

Go to [Explaining Markets](https://portal-beta.explainingmarkets.ai) and click
**Sign in** at the top right, then **Create an account**, and complete the
sign-up flow.

Once you're in, create a submission from the
[Submissions](https://portal-beta.explainingmarkets.ai/submissions) page and
give it a public name. You'll land on its **Overview** tab, which has a
**Setup checklist** that walks you through the rest:

> **Credentials → Webhook URL → Submission is live → Verify your endpoint works**

The next steps map onto that checklist; the submission goes live automatically once
the first two are done.

### 2. Initialize credentials (checklist: *Credentials*)

Click **Initialize credentials** (the checklist's first item) to mint your **API
key** and **webhook signing secret**. A dialog shows them **once**, under the
heading *"Ready to paste into .env"*, already formatted — exactly the two lines this
starter needs:

> `EM_API_KEY=...`
>
> `EM_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...`

Click **Copy** (the dialog won't let you continue until you do) — you won't see
these again, so don't close it before the next step. (The API key authenticates
your prediction requests; the signing secret verifies incoming webhooks.)

**Note:** If you ever need new credentials — e.g., because they were accidentally
leaked — that same item becomes **Replace credentials**. Clicking it mints a new set
you can use to continue from **Step 3**.

### 3. Put your credentials in `.env`

Create your `.env` from the template, then paste the copied box into it, replacing
the two placeholder lines:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

`.env` is what local runs and tests read; the deploy step below pushes the same
values to Railway with one command. (`.env` is gitignored; never commit it. Add
`OPENAI_API_KEY` here too if you want real LLM predictions instead of the
baseline.)

### 4. Deploy

Create a Railway project and deploy this directory into it:

```bash
railway init
railway up
```

Railway doesn't read your local `.env`, so push your credentials to the service
(this triggers a quick redeploy):

```bash
railway variable set $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)
```

(Prefer the dashboard? Your service's **Variables** tab has a raw editor that
accepts the same `KEY=value` lines.) Then mint a public URL:

```bash
railway domain
```

Railway prints a persistent public URL like `https://<your-service>.up.railway.app`.
**That URL is your webhook URL — copy it as-is, nothing to append.** The deployment
keeps running after you close your laptop.

### 5. Set your webhook URL, go live, and verify

Back on the Overview checklist, do **Webhook URL**: paste the URL from the previous
step (it must be reachable over HTTPS in production; `http://` is allowed in dev)
and click **Save webhook URL**. As soon as credentials and a URL are both set,
**Submission is live** flips on automatically — no extra action.

The last item, **Verify your endpoint works**, is optional but recommended. Click
**Send test event** to send a synthetic delivery. Your handler verifies it, sees
`event_type == "TEST"`, and ACKs with 200 without submitting; the checklist then
shows *"Your endpoint responded successfully."* If it doesn't appear right away,
check the **Health** tab for rolling delivery counters.

### 6. Edit `predict.py`

This is the only file you edit. `predict(event)` is called once per event after
verification; return one prediction per focal asset:

```python
def predict(event: dict) -> list[dict]:
    return [
        {"identifier_value": "AAPL", "predicted_percentile": 0.92},
    ]
```

`predicted_percentile` is a float in `[0, 1]` — where you think the asset's
next-day *unexpected* return lands in its historical distribution (0 = worst,
0.50 = median, 1 = best). The default implementation asks an OpenAI model for a
calibrated percentile; with no `OPENAI_API_KEY` set it returns `0.5` so the
round-trip works before you plug in your real model.

Re-deploy after editing:

```bash
railway up
```

Only your first submission for an event is scored — re-POSTing the same event is
accepted but won't overwrite it, so get it right the first time.

---

## Run the tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

All suites run fully offline — no API key, no network. One checks that
`predict()` returns the right shape; one verifies the webhook verifier against
the competition's frozen, published signing vectors; one boots the FastAPI app
and checks that unsigned requests are rejected.

---

## Troubleshooting

Webhook signatures cover the **exact bytes** the server sent. The most common
mistakes (all handled correctly by `app.py`, but worth knowing if you
customize it):

- **Re-serializing the body before verification.** `json.dumps(json.loads(body))`
  reorders keys and adds spaces — verification fails. Always verify the raw bytes.
- **Using `request.json()` instead of `request.body()`.** Same issue: the parsed
  dict is no longer the original byte string. The handler reads `await
  request.body()`.
- **Ignoring the timestamp.** The verifier defaults to a 5-minute tolerance. If
  your clock drifts, pass `tolerance_seconds=` to `verify_webhook`.
- **Not deduping on `Webhook-Id`.** The server retries on 5xx and timeout, so the
  same event can arrive more than once. This app dedupes via an in-memory set
  (see [`docs/advanced.md`](docs/advanced.md) for durable options).

If predictions aren't landing: confirm the service has `EM_API_KEY` and
`EM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` set (`railway variable list` — setting them on Railway, not
just in your local `.env`, is the step people miss), that the submission shows as
live (the checklist's **Submission is live** item), and that you pasted the
`railway domain` URL into the portal. The **Health** tab's prediction counter
should increment for non-TEST events, and `railway logs` tails your service's
output live.

If the deploy's healthcheck fails, the app isn't binding Railway's injected
port — the stock `python app.py` start command already binds `0.0.0.0:$PORT`, so
check that you haven't changed the start command in `railway.json`.

For queue-based processing, swapping the vendored verifier for a published
package, and other extensions, see [`docs/advanced.md`](docs/advanced.md).
